Given an array of n positive integers sorted in descending order.
There are only m non-zero elements and m << n; that is there
could be much more zeroes then non-zeroes in the array.

Given a value x, you are suppose to search for x in
the array and return the index when it is found and
return -1 otherwise. Your algorithm should not be
worst then O(log m).
