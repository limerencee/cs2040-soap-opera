Given a 4-digits number, do the following:
1. check that at least one of the digit is different from the other three.
     For example, 1333 is good but 3333 is not valid.
2. Use the 4 digits from the original number to form the largest number.
3. Use the 4 digits from the original number to form the smallest number.
     For example, if the given number is 2315, the largest number formed is
     5321 and the smallest number is 1235.

You are not allowed to use any sorting method to sort the digits. You should
not have if statements to rank the digits. You can consider these restrictions
as hints on how to solve the problem.
