Consider an empty stack of integers.Let the numbers 1,2,3,4,5,6 be pushed on to this stack only in the order they appeared from left to right.Let S indicates a push and X indicate a pop operation.Can they be permuted into the order 325641(output) and order 154623?(if a permutation is possible give the order of operations.

For example, to obtain the output 654321, the order string is 
SSSSSSXXXXXX

Write a program to do this. Input to the program are the two lists of numbers. The original sorted sequence and the required output order.
Your program should print the order string as described above.
