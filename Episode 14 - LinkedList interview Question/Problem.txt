When you go for IT job interview, the interviewers might ask you this kind of questions.

Given two linked lists which have some common nodes at the end, write a method to find and return a linked list that contains those common nodes.
For example, in the following diagram, your method should return a linked list containing the last three nodes.

head1 -> []-[]-[]
                 \
                  []-[]-[]
                 /
   head2 -> []-[]


Assume that the values in the two linked lists are distinct integers sorted in ascending order. Complete the following method.
You are not allowed to use any additional data structure in your solution but some temporary variables are allowed.
