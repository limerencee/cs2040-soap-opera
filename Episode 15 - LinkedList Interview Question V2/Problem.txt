This is a variation of Episode 14. In this episode, the values in the linkedlist
are not distinct and not sorted but you are allowed to use two other data
structures in your solution. You can only traverse the linkedlists once and
you are not allowed to go through what you stored in the data structures
more than once.
Remember you are to return the reference of the head of the common nodes.
