Assume that you are working as a customer service officer for a company.
Each morning you are given an array of great number (billions) of integers
and throughout the day, your customers will call in and ask you to give them
the sum of all the integers between index i and j. Most of the customers are
very impatient. They expect to get an answer instantly. So you have to come
out with a program to help you do that. But before you implement the program,
you were told to first write an algorithm that accepts two integers, i and j, which
are the indices of the array and find the sum of all the numbers from index i to
index j, inclusive.For example, if the array contains {2, 1, 3, 5, 6, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10),
given 2 and 7 as i and j respectively, your algorithm should answer 33.  
Adding the numbers each time a user makes a query is considered very inefficient.
Devise an algorithm so that the queries can be answered efficiently. You may use
additional data structure in your algorithm.
